# CopsAndRobbers
An algorithm for solving Cops and Robbers problem. 

In an undirected n x n grid there is a robber somewhere on the grid. You have a your disposal n-1 cops to catch this robber. The robber is invisible and cops and robbers move at same time. This algorithm looks to see if this is possible with n-1 cops. It is known to be down with n cops, however it is uncertain how many are actually needed. The algorithm searches through all possible moves to see if there is a combination of moves, which results in the robber being caught.
